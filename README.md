[CLA Hands-On] Courses App with React

Objective

In this hands-on session, you’ll build a Courses Web App that allows users to browse available courses, view course details, and navigate through the app seamlessly using React Router. The primary focus will be on mastering React Router for page navigation and implementing a global Dark Mode toggle using the Context API, one of React’s powerful advanced features.

Key features to implement:
Home page with a list of available courses
Course Details page (dynamic route: /courses/:id)
Navbar with links to Home and About
Not found page for a non existing route
Dark Mode toggle in the navbar that affects the entire app
Responsive design using TailwindCSS or your preferred framework (Bonus)
